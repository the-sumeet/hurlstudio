## Installation

- First, install [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/docs/installation.html).
- Download [HurlStudio](https://github.com/the-sumeet/hurlstudio/releases) from releases, and use.

## Features

- File based.
- Multiple requests per file.
- Response assertion.

- Requests are stored in Hurl file. Hence, not coupled with the app. We can use those files without the app as well.
